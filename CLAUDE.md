# groxpi - Go PyPI Proxy

A high-performance PyPI caching proxy server written in Go, reimplemented from the Python-based proxpi project using Fiber framework and Sonic JSON.

## Project Goals

1. **Maximum Performance**: Leverage Go's concurrency, Fiber framework (2x faster), and Sonic JSON (3x faster) for minimal CPU/memory usage
2. **Feature Parity**: Maintain all features from the original proxpi implementation, extend the power to use S3 as cache backend
3. **Production Ready**: Built for reliability, observability, and ease of deployment

## Architecture Overview

### Technology Stack
- **Language**: Go 1.24+
- **Web Framework**: [Fiber v2](https://gofiber.io/) - Express-inspired, ultra-fast HTTP framework
- **JSON Processing**: [ByteDance Sonic](https://github.com/bytedance/sonic) - Blazingly fast JSON serialization
- **Templates**: Go HTML templates with Fiber integration
- **Cache**: In-memory TTL cache + LRU file cache
- **Storage**: Local filesystem + S3-compatible storage (MinIO/AWS S3)
- **Logging**: [phuslu/log](https://github.com/phuslu/log) - High-performance structured logging
- **Middleware**: Recovery, structured logging, compression

## Architecture Principles

### Simplicity First
- Every change should impact as little code as possible
- Prefer simple, readable solutions over complex optimizations
- Use Go's standard library where possible before adding dependencies

### Performance Guidelines
- Use goroutines for concurrent operations (fetching from multiple indices)
- Implement efficient caching with minimal lock contention
- Stream large files instead of loading into memory
- Follow SingleFlight pattern to reduce IO overhead
- Apply Zero-copy optimization to remove Memory overhead and avoid GC
- Use byte pools for frequent allocations
- Leverage Fiber's built-in optimizations

## Development Workflow

1. **Planning**: Before doing any tasks(features, fix, test,...), look for related documentation in `docs/`,document the approach in `tasks/<task_name>.md`, use `context7` to search for package/framwork documents and ask user to verify your plan
2. **Implementation**: Keep changes small and focused, keep the code follow DRY and YAGNI principals
3. **Testing**: Write tests alongside implementation, always follow TDD
4. **Review**: Self-review for simplicity and performance, update the `tasks/<task_name>.md` before done task
5. **Finish**: Make sure code functionality do not break by running test. Then make documents up-to-date with the codebase.
    6. **Commit**: Before commit, run `gofmt`, `go vet` and `golangci-lint` to ensure the code is well formarted and no linting error
